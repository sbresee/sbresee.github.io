				<img src="profile.jpg" alt="profile">
				<p id="first">My name is Sarah. I've been taking classes at CSM for a year now. I have a degree in Geography from San Francisco State. I have worked as a Geographic Information Specialist for numerous years. I am a mother of three, ages 12, 4 and 4. My hobbies are fitness, nutrition and reading although lately I've been playing a lot of legos.</p>
				<p id="second">I am currently a stay at home mom working on a second career as a web developer and designer. I enjoy the course work and fiddling with code, sometimes to the point of frustration. Given the time I have, I would like to learn as much as possible, including mobile and back-end development.</p>
